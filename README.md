# Mask-Nomask-COVID-Deep-Learning-Real-Time-Classifier


Base model : VGG16 
Additional Layers: Dense layer with 128 neurons + Drouput layer + Dense layer with 128 neurons + Dense layer with 2 neurons
Also performed a network surgery to understand the working of base model and overall model. Found few weak classifiers in the base model.
